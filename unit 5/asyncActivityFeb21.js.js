Inspirations from Existing Games:

Cookie Clicker: Capital Quest is inspired by Cookie Clicker in its incremental earnings mechanics. The players will be earning money by clicking, and as they progress, they will be able to purchase upgrades and automate the earnings, just as Cookie Clicker allows the player to build up an empire of cookies in the long term.

AdVenture Capitalist: The emphasis in this game on investment and incremental growth gives a fundamental outline for Capital Quest. With various investments to be made, from coffee shops to tech companies, the players can see their fortunes grow exponentially, much in the same way the model is used in AdVenture Capitalist.

RollerCoaster Tycoon: The management aspects of RollerCoaster Tycoon shape Capital Quest's strategic components. Players will be required to keep their enterprises running effectively, balancing expenses and profit as they expand their venture options to obtain the optimum earnings, as one would in operating a theme park.
